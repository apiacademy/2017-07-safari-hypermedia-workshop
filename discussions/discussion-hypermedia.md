# Discussion: Hypermedia Advantages and Drawbacks

## Advantages
 * LE keeps original response smaller
 * explore deeper (in the app)
 * server can change URLs w/o impacting clients
 * enables workflow automation (e.g. scraping, etc.)
 * identify a small set of h-factors for a domain
 * quanitifies trustworthiness of content (ranking of a page)
 * self-describing APIs - just navigate to the URLs
 
## Drawbacks
 * increased payload
 * very little tooling/libraries
 * navigation is cumbersome (w/o domain knowledge)
 * searching is tough
 * be cautious of spam sites (injection vulnerabilities)
 * Chatty clients are possible
