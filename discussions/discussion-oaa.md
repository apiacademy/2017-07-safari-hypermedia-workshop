# OAA Challenge Discussion

What changes in a service threaten to cause problems on the client

 * Workflow changes (not actions, just the _order_)
 * Data Structure (fields in a record/object, relationships?)
 * Data validations (type, required/optional, etc.)
 * Some actions are context-based (admins, etc.) -- rules could change
 * New need for authentication, changes in authorization
 * URIs can change over time. new domain, path structure
