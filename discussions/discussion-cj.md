# Collection+JSON Discussion

## Advantages
 * It supports all three of the OAA Challenge elements (eases service changes w/o breaking)
 * supports extensions rather easily/safely
 
## Drawacks
 * Cj's design `buries' the data in name/valyue pairs
 * difficult to read for humans (rather abstract)
 * large payload
 * does not have rendering hints (only limited ones)
 
 
## Other Comments
 * is Cj and alternative to HAL and Siren? (yes, but...)
 * does Cj rely on out-of-band info? (not really)
 * add support for `base` for relative URLs
