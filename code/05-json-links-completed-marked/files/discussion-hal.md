# HAL Discussion

## Advantages
 * Gentle step into hypermedia (keep it simple)
 * easy to retrofit existing JSON APIs
 * simple (easy)
 * support for URI Templates (RFC6570) pretty handy (don't need a form for all filters)

## Drawbacks
 * poor tooling/libriaries (proly about 15 or more libraries for HAL)
 * few general clients
 * doesn't handle unsafe actions (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) easily
 * has limited affordances (h-factors)
 * doesn't make it easy to support changes in the objects/containers (email, etc.)
 * no support for prompts for inputs, etc.
 * HAL has no UI rendering hints.
